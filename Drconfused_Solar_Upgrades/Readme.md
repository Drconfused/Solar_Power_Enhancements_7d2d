THANKYOUS

First and foremost JRBARRIO gets my deepest gratitude for some initial correspondence between him and I on his headshots/dismemberment mod was my initial deeper looking into the xml and its different attributes and I have only got deeper in since.

Thank you Mayic/Jayic for getting me even more excited about adding to my mods and gaining deeper insights into the workings of xml and giving a great sense of community.

Xajar because his flagstone frames are my most used block hands down, until I have enough resources and a good stupply of wet flagstone blocks or self upgrading steel or a crap ton of rebar frames.

And of course a massive thankyou to the FunPimps for continuing to work on this game.
		

MADNESS NOTES

	Sure hope its not a crazy headache in attempting to make more solar bank blocks so that we have more variety of layouts with solar
